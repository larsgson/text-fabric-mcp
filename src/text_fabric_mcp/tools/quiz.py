        Creates a quiz definition from the given parameters, runs the search
        template against Text-Fabric to verify it produces results, and returns
        the complete quiz definition with a preview of how many questions
        would be generated. Nothing is stored on the server.

        Use search_words and get_passage first to explore what's available in
        the passage, then use this tool to package a quiz.

        Available feature names for show_features and request_features:
        - gloss, part_of_speech, verbal_stem, verbal_tense
        - gender, number, person, state, lexeme, language

        Each feature is either shown (given to the student as context),
        requested (the student must answer), or hidden.

        Args:
            title: Quiz title
            book: Book name (e.g. "Genesis", "Psalms")
            chapter_start: Starting chapter
            chapter_end: Ending chapter (default same as start)
            verse_start: Starting verse (None = entire chapter)
            verse_end: Ending verse (None = entire chapter)
            corpus: "hebrew" or "greek"
            search_template: Text-Fabric search template (e.g. "word sp=verb vs=qal")

            request_features: Features the student must answer (e.g. ["verbal_stem", "verbal_tense"])
            max_questions: Max questions (0 = all matches)
            randomize: Shuffle question order
